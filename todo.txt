A list of features to implement, roughly in order of importance:

Synth engine:
- Finish modulation sources/ targets
- Finish filter
- Envelope amount + delay
- Implement additional oscillators:
    - Sample
    - FM
    - PM
- Poly/ Mono modes

UI:
- Loading of wavetable files
- Improved loading/ saving/ copying of sounds
- Dynamic parameter lists (needed when having multiple oscillators)
- Macro controller to controll multiple parameters

MIDI:
- Pitchwheel
- Velocity
- Default controller mapping

General:
- Performance improvements
- Test coverage
